Good question! The reason why installing **AJV** (`ajv`) fixed your React project is due to dependencies used by **Webpack and Schema Utils**, which are essential for running React applications with `react-scripts`.  

---

### **🔹 What is AJV?**
- **AJV (Another JSON Validator)** is a library used to **validate JSON schemas**.
- It is commonly used internally by **Webpack**, **Babel**, and **other build tools** to validate configurations.

---

### **🔹 Why Was AJV Missing?**
- Some versions of `react-scripts`, `webpack`, or `schema-utils` require `ajv` but don’t explicitly list it as a dependency.
- `ajv` might have been **removed or not installed correctly** due to:
  1. **A corrupted `node_modules/` folder**.
  2. **An incomplete `npm install` process**.
  3. **Dependency conflicts between versions**.

---

### **🔹 How Does AJV Affect React?**
React itself **does not** require AJV. However:
- React apps use **Webpack** for bundling and development.
- **Webpack uses `schema-utils` to validate configurations**.
- `schema-utils` **relies on `ajv` to check Webpack settings**.
- If `ajv` is missing, **Webpack cannot start**, and your React app fails.

---

### **🔹 Why Did Installing AJV Fix It?**
By running:

```sh
npm install ajv ajv-keywords --save
```

- You manually installed the missing dependency.
- This allowed `schema-utils` and `webpack` to validate configurations correctly.
- As a result, **React started working**.

---

### **🔹 Permanent Fix**
Instead of manually installing `ajv` every time, you can try:
1. **Upgrading `react-scripts`**:
   ```sh
   npm install react-scripts@latest --save
   ```
2. **Ensuring dependencies are correct**:
   ```sh
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
3. **Checking for updates in Webpack**:
   ```sh
   npm update
   ```

### **🔹 Summary**
| 🔍 Issue | ⚠️ Problem | ✅ Fix |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Missing `ajv` | Webpack & Schema Utils need it for validation | Install `ajv` manually |
| Corrupted `node_modules/` | Incomplete installation | Delete and reinstall dependencies |
| Dependency conflicts | Webpack, Babel, or `react-scripts` might have outdated versions | Upgrade `react-scripts` |
